cases).																								"\1\The time when students are identified as having certain characteristics varies by state. Depending on the state, a student may be included in a category if the relevant characteristic is reported in 9th-grade data, if the characteristic is reported in 12th-grade data, or if it is reported at any point during the student’s high school years."																								\2\Students identified as children with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).																								"\3\Students who met the definition of limited English proficient students as outlined in the EDFacts workbook. For more information, see http://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/eden-workbook.html."																								\4\Students who met the state criteria for classification as economically disadvantaged. 																								"\5\States either report data for a combined ""Asian/Pacific Islander"" group or report the ""Asian"" and ""Pacific Islander"" groups separately. Total represents either a single value reported by the state for ""Asian/Pacific Islander"" or an aggregation of separate values reported for ""Asian"" and ""Pacific Islander."" ""Pacific Islander"" includes the ""Filipino"" group, which only California reports separately."																								"\6\Includes imputed data for Idaho, Kentucky, and Oklahoma. Data were not available for these states because they had not yet started reporting ACGR data in 2010-11 and 2011-12."																								\7\Includes imputed data for Idaho. Data were not available for Idaho because this state had not yet started reporting ACGR data in 2012-13.																								\8\Includes estimated data for Alabama because Alabama did not report data for this subgroup. Estimated Alabama data were based on data published on the Alabama State Education Agency website.																								"\9\Use data with caution. The Alabama State Department of Education has indicated that their ACGR data for some years was misstated. For more information, please see the following press release issued by the state: https://www.alsde.edu/sec/comm/News%20Releases/12-08-2016%20Graduation%20Rate%20Review.pdf."																								"NOTE: The adjusted cohort graduation rate (ACGR) is the percentage of public high school freshmen who graduate with a regular diploma within 4 years of starting 9th grade. Students who are entering 9th grade for the first time form a cohort for the graduating class. This cohort is ""adjusted"" by adding any students who subsequently transfer into the cohort and subtracting any students who subsequently transfer out, emigrate to another country, or die. Values preceded by the "">="" symbol have been ""blurred"" (rounded) to protect student privacy. Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity."																								"SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, Consolidated State Performance Report, 2010-11 through 2016-17.
